# Drink Plaza

Drink Plaza is the home of high class cocktail recipes. This site was created with the intention to help people explore their tastebuds. Drink Plaza will be useful for people who are unsure of what cocktails they are going to mix during gatherings such as birthday parties, holidays, and family dinners.

## Planning

### Before creating this project, I had a lot of thoughts and ideas with how I wanted the final product to look like.

- I generally wanted to go with a very simple but dark theme, that is why I chose the gray background image.
- I wanted to have a really cool cover image which strikes the user with the 'wow' factor. I am very happy with the one I used.
- I wanted to have a recipe section where users can find pictures and lists of ingredients for different cocktails.
- I wanted to have some sort of form section where users can register for weekly newsletters.
- I needed the website to be fully responsive to different screen sizes.
